A GitHub App that prevents merging of Pull Requests based on [configurations](https://github.com/jusx/mergeable#configuration). Make your Pull Requests mergeable only when:

- Certain terms are not in the **title** or **label**.

- The **milestone** on the pull request matches with what is configured.

- There are at least `n` number of **approved reviews**, where `n` is configurable.
