## What It Does
The bot will check new opened and reopened issues if they include some specific contents. Issues not passed will be commented then closed.
## Usage
1. Create a ```/.github/issue-close-bot.yml``` file in your repo. Here's an example:
``` yaml
# Comment that will be sent if an issue is judged to be closed
comment: test
# You can have several configs for different issues.
issueConfigs:
- content:
  - content1
  - content2
  - "üê∂"
- content:
  - "üê±"
```
2. Install the [close-issue-bot](https://github.com/apps/close-issue-bot).
3. Enjoy!
