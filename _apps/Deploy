This app uses GitHub's deployment API and triggers a deployment event when a matching label is applied to a Pull Request. 
Note that this app doesn't actually deploy anything, it just triggers a deployment request which will be forwarded to any webhook listening to the deploy event on your repo or on your organization. Check GitHub's [deployment API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/) for more information.
